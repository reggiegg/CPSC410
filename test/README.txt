INFORMATION ABOUT UNIT TESTS
============================

The unit tests are standard JUnits. They can be run by right-clicking on the "test" file 
(or on individual test classes) and then selecting Run As > JUnit Test.

For additional information about unit tests, see the individual test class files.

INFORMATION ABOUT INTEGRATION TESTS
===================================

We did manual integration testing for this project, since the Initiator used smaller Java
classes, each of which had its own unit tests. 

"Integration testing", then, was running the Initiator (basically the full project) and 
visually checking to ensure the output was correct.
